# Library directory

Files should contain abstract classes.

There should be a matching directory for each abstract class that contains child classes. 

## Example

 * logger.php -> abstract class Logger
 * logger/file.php -> class File extends \Logger
 * logger/null.php -> class Null extends \Logger
